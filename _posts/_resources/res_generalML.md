<summary>:books: Machine Learning a Probabilistic Perspective</summary>
<div markdown='1'>

+ Author : [K. Murphy](https://research.google.com/pubs/KevinMurphy.html).
+ Review : Excellent reference book which covers a wide range of ML topics with a statistical perspective. Probably not a book to read at once or to use as an introduction to the field. Aimed to people with a decent mathematical background. Can sometimes feel a bit disorganized, which is understandable due to the large amount of covered topics.
+ Recommend as : 
    * Reference book to use a refresher for those who already understand of the concepts.
    * To get a probabilistic view of some concepts you already know.
    * Instructors that want a book as a supplement to their class.
+ Notes : famous as a reference book.
+ Level : Intermediate - Advanced.

<summary>:mortar_board: UBC - Undergraduate Machine Learning </summary>
<div markdown='1'>

+ Author : [N. de Freitas](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/).
+ Review : Very good introductory class, very intuitive but also tries to get you used to the necessary math in ML.
+ Recommend as : 
    * Stand-alone videos when you are interested in getting mathematical intuition of a introductory method.
+ Notes : this CPSC 340 class at UBC was my first ML class. My professor was[M. Schmidt](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/) (also great :innocent: but no videos), who replaced Nando after he left to Oxford. I have watched all the talks and online classes from Nando and really enjoy all of them.
+ Level : Beginner.

+ Author : [N. de Freitas](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/).
+ Review : Very good class, with clear mathematical explanations.
+ Recommend as : 
    * Stand-alone videos when you are interested in getting mathematical intuition of a intermediate method.
+ Notes : this was my graduate ML class at UBC, although the topics covered were very different, so I watched all of those videos to.
+ Level : Intermediate.

<summary>:mortar_board: Machine Learning Summer School 2013 </summary>
<div markdown='1'>

+ Author : multiple.
+ Review : Excellent videos of the 2013 Machine Learning Summer School held at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen. Some of the most famous ML professors in Europe come to give introductory lectures about their domain. The complexity of the video really depends on each professor but they all give excellent intuition and explanations about why some methods work.
+ Recommend as : 
    * Stand-alone videos when you have some knowledge of machine learning but would like to get better insights from researchers.
+ Level : Beginner-Advanced.

<!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MOOCS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-->

<summary>:movie_camera: Coursera - Machine Learning </summary>
<div markdown='1'>

+ Author : [A. Ng](andrewng.org).
+ Review : Perfectly mixes mathematical theory, intuition and practice through coding. Covers a very wide range of core machine learning concepts. Gives you the necessary basis to start learning about state of the art machine learning. Doesn't require any prerequisites, if you have some background you will often watch in 2x or skip parts. The only small thing I would have done differently is use python rather than octave.
+ Recommend as : 
    * Course if you don't have a heavy mathematical background but are serious about starting in machine learning.
    * Go-to resource to learn about machine learning.
    * Videos to watch if you didn't really understand something in class.
+ Notes : by far the most famous resource to get into the field, one of the most watched coursera MOOC.
+ Level : Beginner.

<div markdown='1'>

+ Author : [J. Miller](http://jwmi.github.io/index.html).
+ Review : :heart: Excellent machine learning videos, that cover more advanced topics than the other MOOCs I have cited. It is often the best intuitive explanations you can find on some topics.
+ Recommend as : 
    * Supplementary material you should use if you cannot get an intuitive feeling of a certain topic.
+ Level : Beginner.

<summary>:movie_camera: Udacity - Machine Learning </summary>
<div markdown='1'>

+ Author : [M. Littman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_L._Littman), [C. Isbell](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Charles.Isbell/), [P. Kolhe](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/grads/p/pushkar/)
+ Review : Very simple to understand course where the 2 professors try to explain things to each other. Doesn't go too much into mathematical details but gives a very good overview and understanding of the major machine learning concepts. Also a great introductory MOOC. In addition to more classical introductions, it has some great videos on reinforcement learning major concepts.
+ Recommend as : 
    * Introductory MOOC to machine learning as a replacement to coursera's one if you want less math.
    * Videos to watch if you didn't really understand something in class.
    * Videos to watch if you want to have a quick overview of a certain domain.
+ Notes : I would recommend watching a few videos of both MOOC's, stick with one, and watch some videos of the other when you are not satisfied with an explanation.
+ Level : Beginner.

<summary>:headphones: TWiML&Ai </summary>
<div markdown='1'>

+ Author : [S. Charrington](https://twitter.com/samcharrington?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).
+ Review : :heart: I listen to it during all of my daily commutes or when I cook! I really enjoy it: it's an excellent way of getting an overview of what people are doing in the domain (research or industry) while being able to multi task as most of the episodes aren't too technical. What is particular is the wide variety of speakers and covered domains. You can have some of the best researchers in the world, as well business people who learned ML on the fly. I rarely learn about new subjects, but it often gives interesting additional perspectives. The only disadvantage is that some of the industrial episodes can be a bit superficial. This is less the case in the latest episodes also because Sam Charrington asks more technical questions than in the first episodes.
+ Recommend as : 
    * Podcast for multi tasking : daily commute / cleaning / cooking.
    * Podcast for new machine learning enthusiast that do not want to go to much in the details.
    * Podcast for people working in industry who want to have an idea of how machine learning could be applied to their domain

+ Author : [B. Lorica](http://radar.oreilly.com/ben).
+ Review : Before TWiML&AI, I was listening to this one. Very good podcast and speakers. It is mostly focused on scalable enterprise machine learning. I had to try an other podcast while I was waiting for the next episode, I never came back as the subjects covered weren't my favorite (lots of Apache tools). 
+ Recommend as : 
    * Podcast for people who want to use scalable machine learning in their work.
+ Level : Beginner - Intermediate.
